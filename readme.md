# Gulp Breakout

Breakout build environment for better web development. Same interface and such as by old grunt-breakout, but faster with better compression. And, of course, it uses Gulp! MIT license, do what you'd like with it.

Usage:

 * `gulp` - Compiles, but does not minify, assets.
 * `gulp spy` - Serves the site and watches for changes, auto-refreshing the browser.
 * `gulp dist` - Compiles and minifies all assets.
